# Pymaceuticals_Module5
In this repository you will find a README file and a folder named Pymaceuticals.  Within this folder is my code, pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb as well as a folder named data. The data folder contains the 2 csv files that were used for the analysis, Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv.
